Free Applicatives instead of (Free) Monads? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H28QqxO7Ihc
Key slide at 42 minutes in -- Intuition for Free Functor Hierarchy
- Free Functors: Programs that change values
- Free Applicatives: Programs that change data
- Free Monads: Programs that build programs.
Applicatives are less powerful - we lose the sequencing ability - can't rely on runtime data.
Argonaut - scala library for decoding json automatically. Exists in ps? Yup - purescript-argonaut
Natural transformation is better called Functor homomorphism or something. 
DH should maybe be implemented as a FA, switching to monads only when necessary? Let's see what the web3 code generator comes up with.
Ditto for the networks? It's mostly data for now. Will take time until we need to act there.
read filesystem in node -- Purescript-Node-FS-Aff
read json file through node -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEDOFwpoorQ
We might want two configs - json for actual configs, node env for secrets.
Do we want an IDE? The VS demo showing all installed packages that implement a func to automatically add the correct import line is very handy.

Ok. Where do we start. With the config, probably. Nah, we need to parse command line stuff first.
Cmdline stuff kinda works. I can't extract the values from there (Effect Array String, dunno how to extract the strings), but can call a function on them, so I'll try to read the JSON config there. Should have a state monad to keep them, then we can return unit. Who cares.
